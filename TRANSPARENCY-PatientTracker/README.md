TRANSPARENCY-PatientTracker

TRANSPARENCY-PatientTracker is a Hospital Management System developed using Django and Django REST 
Framework. The project is currently in its foundational development phase, focusing on proper system 
setup, virtual environment configuration and version control.
A minimal custom user model has been implemented to support hospital staff roles and departmental 
assignments while preserving Django’s default authentication and administrative features.
Core applications for user management, patient records and visit tracking have been created, with 
successful integration into the Django admin interface. This phase establishes a secure and 
well-structured backend, providing a strong foundation for implementing patient workflow tracking, 
medical records management and billing processes in subsequent stages.
